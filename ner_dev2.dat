West
Indian
_RARE_
Phil
_RARE_
took
four
for
38
on
Friday
as
Leicestershire
beat
Somerset
by
an
innings
and
39
runs
in
two
days
to
take
over
at
the
head
of
the
county
championship
.

Their
stay
on
top
,
though
,
may
be
_RARE_
as
title
rivals
Essex
,
_RARE_
and
Surrey
all
closed
in
on
victory
while
Kent
made
up
for
lost
time
in
their
_RARE_
match
against
Nottinghamshire
.

After
_RARE_
Somerset
out
for
83
on
the
opening
morning
at
_RARE_
_RARE_
,
Leicestershire
extended
their
first
innings
by
_RARE_
runs
before
being
bowled
out
for
_RARE_
with
England
_RARE_
Andy
_RARE_
taking
three
for
83
.

_RARE_
by
_RARE_
,
Somerset
got
a
_RARE_
start
to
their
second
innings
before
_RARE_
stepped
in
to
_RARE_
them
out
for
_RARE_
.

Essex
,
however
,
look
certain
to
_RARE_
their
top
spot
after
_RARE_
Hussain
and
Peter
_RARE_
gave
them
a
firm
_RARE_
on
their
match
against
Yorkshire
at
Headingley
.

Hussain
,
considered
surplus
to
England
's
one-day
_RARE_
,
struck
_RARE_
,
his
first
championship
century
of
the
season
,
as
Essex
reached
_RARE_
and
took
a
first
innings
lead
of
82
.

By
the
close
Yorkshire
had
turned
that
into
a
_RARE_
advantage
but
_RARE_
_RARE_
had
_RARE_
their
hopes
,
taking
four
for
24
in
48
balls
and
leaving
them
_RARE_
on
_RARE_
for
five
and
_RARE_
for
rain
.

At
the
Oval
,
Surrey
captain
Chris
Lewis
,
another
man
_RARE_
by
England
,
continued
to
_RARE_
his
critics
as
he
followed
his
four
for
45
on
Thursday
with
80
not
out
on
Friday
in
the
match
against
Warwickshire
.

He
was
well
backed
by
England
_RARE_
Mark
_RARE_
who
made
70
as
Surrey
closed
on
_RARE_
for
seven
,
a
lead
of
_RARE_
.

_RARE_
kept
up
the
hunt
for
their
first
championship
title
since
_RARE_
by
_RARE_
Worcestershire
to
_RARE_
for
five
in
their
second
innings
,
still
100
runs
away
from
_RARE_
an
innings
defeat
.

After
the
_RARE_
of
_RARE_
the
opening
day
of
their
match
badly
affected
by
the
weather
,
Kent
stepped
up
a
_RARE_
to
_RARE_
Nottinghamshire
for
_RARE_
.

They
were
held
up
by
a
_RARE_
_RARE_
from
Paul
Johnson
but
_RARE_
fast
_RARE_
Martin
_RARE_
took
four
for

.

By

Kent
had
reached

for

The

_RARE_
_RARE_
Alan
_RARE_
was
named
as
the
new
England
captain
on
Friday
.

The
_RARE_
,
who
joined
Newcastle
for
15
million
pounds
sterling
(
$
_RARE_
million
)
,
takes
over
from
Tony
Adams
,
who
led
the
side
during
the
European
championship
in
June
,
and
former
captain
David
_RARE_
.

Adams
and
_RARE_
are
both
injured
and
will
miss
England
's
opening
World
Cup
qualifier
against
Moldova
on
Sunday
.

_RARE_
takes
the
_RARE_
on
a
trial
basis
,
but
new
coach
_RARE_
_RARE_
said
he
saw
no
reason
why
the
former
Blackburn
and
_RARE_
_RARE_
should
not
make
the
post
his
own
.

"
I
'm
sure
there
wo
n't
be
a
problem
,
I
'm
sure
Alan
is
the
man
for
the
job
,
"
_RARE_
said
.

"
There
were
three
or
four
people
who
could
have
done
it
but
when
I
spoke
to
Alan
he
was
up
for
it
and
really
wanted
it
.

"
In
four
days
it
's
very
difficult
to
come
to
a
100
percent
_RARE_
about
something
like
this
...

but
he
_RARE_
how
to
_RARE_
himself
,
his
team
_RARE_
respect
him
and
he
_RARE_
about
the
team
situation
even
though
he
plays
up
front
.

_RARE_
's
Euro

partner
_RARE_
_RARE_
withdrew
from

but

_RARE_
MaliVai
Washington
and
Marcelo
Rios
were
not
so
_RARE_
on
a
night
of
_RARE_
at
the
U.S.
Open
.

The
_RARE_
Washington
fell
short
of
_RARE_
his
Wimbledon
_RARE_
_RARE_
as
he
lost
to
_RARE_
_RARE_
Alex

3-6
6-3
in
a

_RARE_

on

_RARE_
,
10th

Rios
lost
to
another

with
a

connection
--

Jeff
_RARE_
.

The
_RARE_
_RARE_
defeated
the
_RARE_
6-4
4-6
7-6
6-2
.

The
day
programme
went
_RARE_
although
_RARE_
former
champion
Agassi
had
to
_RARE_
out
of
a
dangerous
3-6
_RARE_
_RARE_
,
winning
18
of
the
last
19
games
against
India
's
_RARE_
_RARE_
.

But
the
night
_RARE_
to
the
_RARE_
.

Washington
,
who
climbed
back
from
a
_RARE_
deficit
,
two
sets
down
in
the
third
set
against
Todd
Martin
in
the
Wimbledon
_RARE_
,
looked
_RARE_
for
another
_RARE_
_RARE_
.

O'Brien
,
a
winner
two
weeks
ago
in
New
_RARE_
for
his
first
_RARE_
title
,
served
for
the
match
at
_RARE_
in
the
third
set
before
Washington
came
_RARE_
back
.

"
I
just
kept
saying
to
_RARE_
,
'
keep
giving
_RARE_
the
best
chance
to
win
,
keep
_RARE_
,
maybe
something
will
happen
,
'
"
said
the
_RARE_
O'Brien
,
ranked
_RARE_
.

"
I
kept
my
_RARE_
and
I
was
_RARE_
of
_RARE_
for
that
--
_RARE_
I
would
have
_RARE_
up
the
_RARE_
and
gone
home
.
"

The
_RARE_
O'Brien
,
a
former
U.S.
_RARE_
national
champion
,
fired
up
17
_RARE_
to
_RARE_
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
Washington
.

The
fifth
set
stayed
on
serve
until
the
sixth
game
,
when
Washington
,
after
_RARE_
one
break
point
with
a
_RARE_
winner
down
the
line
,
_RARE_
a
_RARE_
to
give
O'Brien
a
4-2
lead
.

The
_RARE_
_RARE_
in
two
_RARE_
to
hold
serve
at
5-2
and
then
_RARE_
his
eighth
match
point
for
victory
when
Washington
found
the
net
with
another
_RARE_
from
_RARE_
.

"
You
just
_RARE_
of
keep
fighting
and
you
keep
trying
to
make
him
play
a
little
bit
.

I
think
he
got
a
little
tight
at
a
couple
of
_RARE_
,
"
said
Washington
.
"

But
I
think
he
served
pretty
well
when
he
had
to
.
"

_RARE_
,
whose
Wimbledon
_RARE_
two
years
ago
brought
him
a
$
_RARE_
fine
and
suspension
from
this
year
's
tournament
at
the
_RARE_
_RARE_
,
_RARE_
calls
and
_RARE_
fans
in
his
_RARE_
two
hour
,
24
minute
_RARE_
with
Rios
on
the
_RARE_
.

A
_RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
backed
the
_RARE_
_RARE_
and
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
American
,
who
_RARE_
up
all
the
attention
.

"
I
'm
an
_RARE_
player
,
"
said
the
_RARE_
_RARE_
.
"

I
think
I
played
very
well
_RARE_
,
very
_RARE_
.
"

The
match
turned
on
the
_RARE_
_RARE_
,
which
the
American
won
7-5
much
to
the
_RARE_
of
the
_RARE_
.

"
I
love
the
crowd
if
they
_RARE_
me
every
day
.

It
_RARE_
me
up
,
makes
me
play
my
best
tennis
,
"
_RARE_
said
.

"
I
played
some
of
my
best
tennis
in
college
when
_RARE_
were
_RARE_
_RARE_
on
me
.

If
tennis
was
like
that
every
day
,
I
think
_RARE_
_RARE_
be
having
a
lot
more
fun
.
"

Rios
did
not
_RARE_
_RARE_
's
_RARE_
.

"
He
's
always
_RARE_
too
much
,
"
said
Rios
.
"

But
I
think
it
's
not
that
.

I
think
I
played
really
bad
.

It
was
tough
to
play
at
night
.

_RARE_
were
going
really
fast
.

I
lost
too
many
points
that
I
never
lose
.

I
did
n't
play
my
tennis
.
"

"
I
do
n't
see
the
ball
like
I
see
during
the
day
.

I
play
an
American
so
that
's
why
I
play
at
night
.

I
did
n't
feel
good
on
the
court
.
"

At
the
end
of
the
match
,
_RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
to
the
crowd
,
then
_RARE_
his
body
to
a

in
a
_RARE_
_RARE_
.

"
I
support
their
_RARE_
,
"
_RARE_
said
about
the
fans
.
"

At
the
same
time
,
they
're
_RARE_
_RARE_
against
me
.

After
I
won
I
_RARE_
I
could
give
them
a
little

with
net

rising

33

on

,
keeping

well
below

_RARE_
's
_RARE_
output
rose
to

From

_RARE_
59
percent
of
its

,
up
from
_RARE_
percent
in

period
last

.

The
company
said
higher
than
_RARE_
inflation
and
rising
_RARE_
materials
and
wage
costs
also
hit
profits
.

_RARE_
inflation
,
initially
estimated
at
20
percent
in
December
,
was
_RARE_
percent
in
June
,
higher
than

The
12

The

,
its

level
since
_RARE_
in

the

_RARE_

and
that
heavy

helped
pressure

_RARE_

_RARE_

_RARE_
_RARE_
that

However
,
December
_RARE_

below

at

as

The
December
_RARE_
_RARE_
continued
to
_RARE_

also
_RARE_
the

's
fear
of

.

there

_RARE_
_RARE_
,

_RARE_
,
said
the
U.S.

adding
the

Iraqi
_RARE_
of
Sudanese
jet
charged
with
_RARE_
.

LONDON
1996-08-30

Seven
Iraqis
who
seized
a
Sudanese
airliner
with
199
people
aboard
and
forced
it
to
fly
to
London
were
on
Friday
charged
with
_RARE_
,
ending
speculation
that
they
might
be
offered
immediate
asylum
in
Britain
.

Police
said
the
seven
men
,
who
freed
all
their
hostages
after
the
plane
landed
at
Stansted
airport
on
Tuesday
and
then
_RARE_
for
asylum
,
would
appear
in
court
on
Saturday
.

The
Iraqis
claimed
they
were
"
ordinary
people
_RARE_
by
the
regime
of
Saddam
(
Hussein
)
"
but
interior
ministry
officials
had
_RARE_
said
it
was
likely
the
seven
would
be
charged
with
_RARE_
before
any
_RARE_
for
asylum
was
considered
.

Under
English
law
the
maximum
sentence
for
_RARE_
is
life
imprisonment
,
but
there
has
been
widespread
speculation
that
the
seven
will
receive
_RARE_
sentences
and
then
be
allowed
to
stay
rather
than
being
sent
back
to
Iraq
.

The
_RARE_
began
on
Monday
when
an
_RARE_
plane
was
taken
over
shortly
after
it
took
off
from
Khartoum
.

The
hijackers
threatened
to
blow
it
up
during
a
_RARE_
stop
in
Cyprus
unless
they
were
taken
to
London
.

After
a
search
of
the
aircraft
following
the
hijackers
'
surrender
,
police
found
only

and

explosives

will
not
be

"
We
will
not
achieve
the

37

forecast
,
"
_RARE_

_RARE_

we
cannot

that
has
been

of
the

_RARE_
declined
to

for

"
_RARE_
,
at
some
point
it
_RARE_
a
buying
opportunity
,
"
_RARE_
said
.
"

I
think
the
_RARE_
is
that
we
operate
in

markets
,
_RARE_
markets
_RARE_
to
be
more
_RARE_
.
"

"
_RARE_
message
is
that
the

not
changed

The

of
_RARE_
million
French

compared
to

million
in
the
same
six
months
of

Net
profit
for
the
_RARE_
1996
period
was
_RARE_
million
French

,
down
from
_RARE_
million
in
the
first
six
months
of
1995
,
with
the
bulk
of
this

and
people
who
have

_RARE_

_RARE_
for
political
_RARE_
that
could
have
an
impact
on

Analysts
believe
that
the
candidates
will
add
to
the
market
's
list
of
_RARE_
,
which
already
includes
the
question
of
whether
the
Federal
Reserve
will
_RARE_
interest
rates
to
cool
economic
growth
.

They
say
the
politicians
will
need

that

_RARE_
off

"
The
worst
thing
that
could
happen
for

is
that
if
Clinton
and
Dole
start
to
trade
shots
in
the
_RARE_

_RARE_
Johnson

"
That
's
when

He
said
that

would
be
the

to
_RARE_
if
the

_RARE_
"
_RARE_
and
stocks
would
quickly
drop
as

rates
rise
.

"
I
do
n't
think
it
would
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
of
the
stock
market
,
unless
the
rise
in
rates
_RARE_
off
a
_RARE_
within
the
market
,
which
would
include
selling
by
portfolio
_RARE_
,
_RARE_
by
_RARE_
of
mutual

that
would

in

pressure

and
give

tax
_RARE_
to

people
off

welfare
_RARE_
.

Clinton
claims
Dole
's
plan
would
increase
the
deficit
,
while
the
White
House
said
some
corporate
taxes
would
be
raised
to
offset
the
cost
of
the

's
plan
.

The
experts
said
there
are
some
_RARE_
_RARE_
for
the
market
from
this
year
's
political
season
because
the

could
_RARE_
Wall

expectations
that

will

"
The

will
have
to
_RARE_
the

then
do

_RARE_
.

_RARE_
the
past
four
presidential
elections
,
the
candidate
that
has
_RARE_
tax
cuts
has
won
.

Ronald
Reagan
's
tax
cut
won
him
a
second
_RARE_
term
in
the
White
House
in
_RARE_
,
while
Democrat
_RARE_
_RARE_
,
who
promised
higher
taxes
,
lost
.

George
_RARE_
became
president
in
1988
on
his
_RARE_
campaign
and
Clinton
won
in
1992
with
a
_RARE_
to
_RARE_
workers
'
_RARE_
.

The
_RARE_
,
they
said
,
will
be
for
the
candidates
to
continue
to
_RARE_
Wall
Street
that
the
Treasury
's
_RARE_
bond
--
the
most
_RARE_
interest
rate
--
will
fall
to
between
4
percent
and
5
percent
by
the
end
of
the
_RARE_
.

Johnson
said
that
long-term
interest
rates
have
already
been
_RARE_
by
the
election
.

The
long-term
bond
_RARE_
this
week
to
_RARE_
percent
after
starting
the
year
at
_RARE_
percent
.

The
surge
of
buying
in
stocks
during
the
last
two
years
has
come
amid
an
_RARE_
of
low
interest
rates
,
which
has
boosted
corporate
profits
.

But
the
market
_RARE_
this
summer
after
the
Dow
Jones
industrial
average
set
a
record
high
of
_RARE_
points
on
May
22
.

"
The
market
does
n't
_RARE_
to
be
able
to
make
new
_RARE_
and
it
has
been
back
and
_RARE_
in
a
fairly
_RARE_
_RARE_
which
_RARE_
like
a
holding
_RARE_
,
"
said
_RARE_
.

He
said
the
market
_RARE_
the
political
_RARE_
,
now
that
Dole
has
sharply
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
with
Clinton
in
the
polls
.

_RARE_
said
that
the
one
thing
that
could
_RARE_
turn
the
election
around
are
new
_RARE_
in
the
_RARE_
scandal
that
would
damage
the
_RARE_
.

"
_RARE_
are
on
a
_RARE_
edge
because
if
something
_RARE_
that
_RARE_
like
it
could
_RARE_
the
presidency
,
it
could
_RARE_
the
political
and

to
some
_RARE_

process
into
_RARE_

"
_RARE_
said
.

_RARE_
now
,
Wall
Street
is
_RARE_
the
candidates
.

"
We
have
an
election
where
there
are
so
many
unknown
_RARE_
that
most
people
will
probably
want
to
hold
fire
,
and
even
take
the
chance
that
they
will
have
to
pay
higher
prices
for
stocks
after
the
November
election
,
than
take
the
risk
that
a
_RARE_

the

will
hurt
the
stock

WASHINGTON
1996-08-30

U.S.
_RARE_
Department
officials
said
Friday
that
Mexican
_RARE_
--
which
are
_RARE_
from
entering
the
_RARE_
United
States
--
will
not
likely
be
entering
U.S.
markets
any
time
soon
,
even
if
the
controversial
ban
were
lifted
today
.

"
The
opportunity
to
import
(
Mexican
_RARE_
)
probably
wo
n't
become
possible
for
another
year
,
"
said
Paul
_RARE_
,
senior
trade
_RARE_
to
_RARE_
Secretary
Dan
_RARE_
.

"
We
could
lift
the
ban
_RARE_
,
but
that
would
not
mean
anything
immediately
,
"
said
_RARE_
.
"

We
probably
would
not
see
_RARE_
come
in
until
next
season
,
next
November
.
"

The
_RARE_
Department
proposed
more
than
a
year
ago
to
_RARE_
_RARE_
an
_RARE_
ban
on
Mexican
_RARE_
.

Under
the
administration
's
proposal
,
the
_RARE_
to
the
Mexican
produce
would
be
opened
into
19
_RARE_
and
_RARE_
states
from
November
through
February
.

The
plan
has
raised
a
storm
of
protest
from
U.S.
_RARE_
_RARE_
,
who
are
largely
_RARE_
in
California
.

California
_RARE_
have
charged
that
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
,
even
on
a
limited
basis
,
would
_RARE_
the
$
1
billion
U.S.
industry
if
_RARE_
_RARE_
Mexican
_RARE_
were
brought
into
the
country
along
with
the
_RARE_
.

Mexican
officials
_RARE_
that
there
is
no
scientific
basis
for
the
ban
,
and
that
it
is
illegal
under
international
trading
rules
of
the
World
Trade
Organisation
.

_RARE_
of
the
plan
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
of
the
U.S.
_RARE_
and
say
the
plan
has
enough
_RARE_
built
into
it
to
_RARE_
any
significant
threat
to
American
producers
.

Under
the
proposal
,
only
imports
of
_RARE_
_RARE_
growing
in
approved
_RARE_
in
_RARE_
,
Mexico
,
the
country
's
main
_RARE_
area
,
would
be
allowed
.

Mexican
_RARE_
and
_RARE_
would
have
to
_RARE_
by
_RARE_
rules
established
by
the
Mexican
and
U.S.
_RARE_
_RARE_
.

The
California
_RARE_
Commission
--
which
has
_RARE_
the
opposition
to
lifting
the
ban
--
said
new
data
the
group
_RARE_
to
the
_RARE_
Department
last
spring
shows
the
department
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
problem
in
Mexico
and
have
_RARE_
that
the
agency
_RARE_
its
study
of
the
issue
.

The
administration
is
still
_RARE_
the
new
data
,
and
officials
have
said
that
if
experts
think
the
information
is
significant
,
the
agency
could
_RARE_
its
investigation
.

But
U.S.
_RARE_
industry
sources
said
that
while
they
may
have
delayed
the
plan
for
a
while
,
they
_RARE_
do
not
expect
the
administration
to
change
its
position
.

"
From
a
_RARE_
view
,
the
department
should
_RARE_
this
plan
,
but
due
to
politics
they
will
probably
go
ahead
with
this
,
"
said
Tom
_RARE_
of
the
California
_RARE_
group
.

_RARE_
officials
said
they
want
to
get
the
issue
_RARE_
as
quickly
as
possible
,
but
said
there
is
no
timetable
they
are
working
under
.

"
It
's
a
very
_RARE_
issue
,
"
said
the
_RARE_
Department
's
_RARE_
.
"

We
'll
get
it
_RARE_
as
quickly
as
we
can
,
based
on
the
best
available
_RARE_

made
him
more

have
told

there
was
only
a
_RARE_
chance
of
a
_RARE_
and
the
_RARE_
_RARE_
was
_RARE_
.

"
It
's
not
going

be
easy
to
say
_RARE_
to
_RARE_

_RARE_
does
have
some

_RARE_
to
it

and
_RARE_
_RARE_
by
$
_RARE_
billion
in
July
after
_RARE_
$
45
billion
in
June
.

"
In
July
,
average
weekly
hours
and
average
_RARE_
earnings
declined
,
more
than
_RARE_
the
effect
of
an
increase
in
_RARE_
,
"
_RARE_
said
.

But
more
money
went
into
_RARE_
_RARE_
,
as
_RARE_
held
at
_RARE_
cents
out
of
each
dollar
earned
in
both
June
and
July
.

That
was
the
highest
_RARE_
rate
since
October
last
year
,
when
5.5
cents
out
of

earned
was
being
_RARE_
.

The
generally
_RARE_
report
on
spending
and
_RARE_
in

had
been
expected
.

At

,
the

said
in

that

_RARE_
climbed
strongly
in

with

_RARE_
increased
_RARE_
percent
to
a
_RARE_
_RARE_
$
_RARE_
billion
,
_RARE_
stronger
than
the

percent
rise
forecast
by
Wall
Street
_RARE_
.

That
followed
a
revised
_RARE_
percent
decline
in
June
orders
.

_RARE_
said
previously
that
spending
at
retail
stores
was
up
only
_RARE_
percent
in
July
,
partly
because
of

sales
of
new

and
light
_RARE_
.

In
addition
,
the
Labour
Department
's
July
_RARE_
report
had
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
income
growth
.

It
showed
average
_RARE_

fell
in
July
by

percent
to

11.00
and
the
average
_RARE_

from

in

_RARE_
in

which
includes

as

are

_RARE_

all

,
fell
to
an
annual
rate
of
$
_RARE_
billion
in
July
from

But
spending

increased

Italian
_RARE_
and
_RARE_
giant
_RARE_
on

announced
its
_RARE_
move
into
China
with
a
_RARE_
joint
venture
set
to
_RARE_
on
the
_RARE_
Chinese
_RARE_
market
.

_RARE_
is
linking
with
Hong
_RARE_
group
_RARE_
_RARE_
in
a
venture
to
be
called
the
_RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
Ltd
,
which
will
operate
in
partnership
with
a
local
industrial
company
at
its
existing
factory
in
_RARE_
,
_RARE_
province
,
Shanghai
.

The
partners
will
_RARE_
around
$
30

in
the
existing
copper
_RARE_
plant
at
_RARE_
to
_RARE_
_RARE_

include
_RARE_
_RARE_
production
,
with
annual
turnover
expected
to

The

marks

"
This
is
really
positive

for
_RARE_
,
and
I
expect
that
it
will
produce
one
of
the

_RARE_
results
in

compared
to
other

Italian
companies
,
"
said
analyst
_RARE_
_RARE_
at

She
_RARE_
that
the

was
positive
because

it
also
showed
another

A
_RARE_
attempt
to
_RARE_
activity
in

bond
futures
has
been
delayed
to
give
_RARE_
a
chance
to

the
European
_RARE_

(

said
on

_RARE_
in
the
_RARE_
_RARE_
contract
was
expected
to
begin
today
,
but
an
_RARE_
spokesman
said
the
10
banks
and
brokers
involved
in
the
_RARE_
needed
time
to
get
_RARE_
to
changes
in
the
_RARE_
trading
system
.

"
It
's
not
ready
yet
.

We
found
it
_RARE_
to
take
some
time
between
the
commitment
to
start
and
the
_RARE_
start
,
"
_RARE_
spokesman
_RARE_
van

told

He
said
no
date
had
been
_RARE_
yet
for
the
start
of
price
making
in

contract
,
but
the
_RARE_
had
agreed
to
speak
again
to
the
_RARE_
in
one
to
two
weeks
.

Investors
in
Dutch
bonds
currently
use
German
bond
futures
to
_RARE_
their
_RARE_
because
the
_RARE_
contract
is
so
_RARE_

A

to
_RARE_

contract
two

failed

BONN
1996-08-30

The
head
of
an
international
_RARE_
mission
_RARE_
its
record
on
Friday
in
the
face
of
_RARE_
by
_RARE_
leaders
in

Chechnya
and
insisted
it
was
doing
its
best
to
bring
peace
to

_RARE_
_RARE_
,
the
chairman
of
the
Organisation
for
Security

Cooperation
in

)
,
told
German
radio
the
_RARE_
body
_RARE_
the
conflict
in
Chechnya
as
an
internal
Russian
problem
.

"
The
OSCE
is
_RARE_
involved
.

But
one
must
not
_RARE_
that
the
OSCE
only
has
limited
powers
there
,
"
said
_RARE_
,
who
is
also
the
Swiss
foreign
minister
.
"

Our
mission
in
Chechnya
has
done
all
it
can
within
the
given
_RARE_
.
"

_RARE_
leaders
in
Chechnya
have
criticised
Tim
_RARE_
,
the
Swiss
diplomat
who
heads
the
OSCE
Chechnya
mission
,
saying
he
was
_RARE_
toward
_RARE_
_RARE_
,
president
of
the
_RARE_
separatist
government
.

Russian
_RARE_
Alexander
Lebed
and
Chechen
separatist
military
leader
Aslan
Maskhadov
started
a
new
round
of
peace
talks
on
Friday
just
outside
the
rebel
region
.

_RARE_
said
Chechnya
must
remain
part
of
Russia
,
but
the
solution
to
the
conflict
would
be
to
accord
the
region
maximum
autonomy
within
Russia
's
_RARE_
.

"
There
is
no
doubt
that
Chechnya
,
according
to
OSCE
_RARE_
,
_RARE_
to
a
state
called
Russia
,
"
he
said
,
_RARE_
out
that
Russia
was
an
OSCE
member
and
it
was
not
the
_RARE_
's
policy
to
challenge
members
'
_RARE_
.

He
added
that
the
OSCE
was
the
only
international
body
which
has
been
allowed
into
the
Chechnya
to
_RARE_
the
human
rights
situation
there
,
but
that
its
means
were
_RARE_
by
the
fact
that
the
conflict
was
a
"
internal
issue
"
.

"
We
have
a
small
_RARE_
,
the
details
of
which
have
yet
to
be
worked
out
.

Chechnya
must
be
_RARE_
the
maximum
autonomy
possible
within
the
_RARE_
of

_RARE_
that

JOHANNESBURG
_RARE_

South
Africa
managed
to
avoid
a
fifth
successive
defeat
in
1996
at
the
hands
of
the
All
Blacks
with
an
_RARE_
_RARE_
victory
in
front
of
an
_RARE_
_RARE_
Park
crowd
on
Saturday
.

They
scored
three
tries
in
_RARE_
their
highest
total
against
New
Zealand
,
_RARE_
some
_RARE_
in
a
season
in
which
the
world
champions
have
lost
five
out
of
eight
tests
.

It
also
ended
a
run
of
nine
successive
_RARE_
this
year
for
New
Zealand
but
arrived
too
late
to
prevent
a
2-1
series
defeat
and
an
_RARE_
first
All
Black
series
_RARE_
on
South
African
_RARE_
.

_RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
van
der
_RARE_
was
his
side
's
_RARE_
,
scoring
their
opening
try
and
making
the
third
for
_RARE_
Andre
_RARE_
from
a
quickly
taken
penalty
to
give
his
side
a
_RARE_
lead
after
54
minutes
.

_RARE_
Andre
_RARE_
scored
the
other
,
_RARE_
in
from
40
metres
at
the
start
of
the
second
half
to
add
to
his
three
_RARE_
penalties
.

The
All
Blacks
_RARE_
some
_RARE_
by
scoring
two
tries
from
centre
_RARE_
_RARE_
and
_RARE_
Justin
_RARE_
in
the
final
five
minutes
to
close
a
_RARE_
which
at
one
point
stood
at
24
points
.

But
they
generally
_RARE_
an
_RARE_
,
_RARE_
by
recalled
_RARE_
Andrew
_RARE_
who
missed
five
out
of
eight
_RARE_
at
goal
.

_RARE_
_RARE_
Henry
_RARE_
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
into
a
6-0
lead
after
10
minutes
only
to
see
Andrew
_RARE_
launch
a
penalty
from
eight
metres
inside
his
own
half
to
narrow
the
_RARE_
.

_RARE_
missed
three
further
penalties
and
a
_RARE_
in
the
first
40
minutes
which
could
have
put
his
side
ahead
,
but
it
was
the
_RARE_
who
looked
the
more
dangerous
.

Their
_RARE_
was
realised
when
_RARE_
made
a
_RARE_
break
in
the
_RARE_
minute
and
,
although
_RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
appeared
to
_RARE_
on
_RARE_
's
_RARE_
pass
,
_RARE_
_RARE_
Derek
_RARE_
allowed
Van
der
_RARE_
to
_RARE_
up
and
score
under
the
posts
.

_RARE_
_RARE_
and
_RARE_
_RARE_
a
penalty
before
All
Black
_RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
scored
a
try
from
close
range
on
the
_RARE_
of
_RARE_
to
narrow
the
lead
to
_RARE_
and
_RARE_
at
a
_RARE_
.

_RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
another
long
penalty
and
then
_RARE_
around
the
outside
of
the
defence
to
score
the
_RARE_
'
second
try
.

A
quick
penalty
from
Van
der
_RARE_
five
metres
from
the
All
Black
line
set
up
the
third
try
for
_RARE_
five
minutes
later
and
when
_RARE_
_RARE_
his
third
penalty
the
_RARE_
held
an
_RARE_
_RARE_
lead
going
into
the
last
quarter
.

When
the
All
Blacks
did
break
through
,
it
was
too
late
.

Centre
_RARE_
_RARE_
followed
up
_RARE_
'
kick
to
score
under
the
posts
and
_RARE_
Justin
_RARE_
forced
himself
over
from
a
_RARE_
close
to
the
line
in
_RARE_
to
give
them
some
_RARE_
.

HONG
KONG
_RARE_

_RARE_
Australian
Anthony
Hill
called
_RARE_
Khan
a
_RARE_
during
his
_RARE_
defeat
by
the
world
number
one
in
the
Hong
Kong
Open
_RARE_
on
Saturday
.

The
match
_RARE_
over
when
Hill
made
to
walk
off
court
after
what
he
claimed
was
a
_RARE_
point
in
the
third
.

When
the
_RARE_
called
_RARE_
's
return
good
and
the
decision
was
accepted
by
the
player
,
Hill
_RARE_
at
the
Pakistani
:
"
You
_RARE_
.
"

"
He
was
standing
right
there
and
knew
the
shot
was
down
so
I
called
him
a
_RARE_
,
"
said
Hill
,
whose
_RARE_
career
has
been
_RARE_
by
_RARE_
and
_RARE_
for
_RARE_
_RARE_
.

"
He
knew
it
was
down
and
accepted
what
I
called
him
because
of
that
.
"

Hill
won
the
game
on
the
next
point
and
said
later
that
_RARE_
was
generally
_RARE_
on
court
but
played
by
the
_RARE_
's
decision
.

The
Australian
had
_RARE_
_RARE_
's
_RARE_
with
his
_RARE_
of
_RARE_
and
_RARE_
_RARE_
but
eventually
_RARE_
15-7
_RARE_
_RARE_
15-8
.

"
I
changed
my
strategy
against
him
today
and
had
him
_RARE_
,
"
he
added
.

He
is
not
as
_RARE_
as
he
used
to
be
be
but
was
too
good
for
me
in
the
end
.

I
_RARE_
him
a
bit
but
he
will
come
out
next
time
and
be
a
better
player
for
it
--
that
's
_RARE_
.
"

_RARE_
said
that
he
was
_RARE_
to
be
called
a
_RARE_
.
"

What
he
did
was
bad
for
_RARE_
,
bad
for
the
crowd
and
bad
for
the
_RARE_
.

"
We
are
trying
to
build
up
_RARE_
like
tennis
and
players
should
not
say
things
like
that
.

"
I
think
the
_RARE_
_RARE_
Association
should
look
into
this
matter
and
deal
with
it
_RARE_
.

I
am
not
calling
for
him
to
be
banned
but
they
have
to
take
some
action
.

_RARE_
,
who
defeated
_RARE_
in
the
_RARE_
of
the
Portuguese
Open
in
1993
,
said
that
he
would
like
to
win
for
the
good
of
the
game
.

"
I
have
nothing
against
_RARE_
but
it
will
be
great
if
I
could
beat
him
,
"
said
_RARE_

"

_RARE_
biggest
problem
against
_RARE_
is
_RARE_
.

I
want
to
beat

badly
that
I
just
cannot

_RARE_
on
the

_RARE_
their
3-2
defeat
in
the

last
year
when
they
_RARE_
Spain
on
September
_RARE_
in

.

"
Last
year
we
stood
on
the

after
we
had
lost
and
we
put
out
hands
together
and
made
it
our
_RARE_
to
bring
back
the
Cup
,
"
U.S.
captain
_RARE_
Jean
King
said
at
the
draw
.
"

That
is
our
_RARE_
goal
.
"

The
United
States
edged
Austria
in
_RARE_
3-2
in
the
opening
round
in
April
,
and
then
_RARE_
Japan
_RARE_
in
_RARE_
last
month
in
the
_RARE_
.

The
victory
against
Japan
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
Cup
debut
of
Monica
Seles
,
who
became
a
_RARE_
U.S.
citizen
in
1994
.

Seles
_RARE_
won
both
her
singles
matches
and
King
is
_RARE_
on
the
_RARE_
number
one
to
lead
the
team
again
.

"
I
told
Monica
we
need
her
if
we
want
to
win
,
"
King
said
.

Seles
's
_RARE_
left
_RARE_
and
a
wrist
injury
to
_RARE_
Cup
veteran
Mary
_RARE_
Fernandez
have
forced
King
to
take
a
wait
and
see
_RARE_
regarding
her
squad
for
the
_RARE_
match
.

Fernandez
was
forced
to
_RARE_
from
the
U.S.

.

"
We
will
wait
until
the
last
minute
so
we
check
with
_RARE_
and
their
injuries
,
"
said
King
.
"

What
we
like
would
be
Seles
,
(
Olympic
champion
Lindsay
)
Davenport
and
Mary
_RARE_
Fernandez
.
"

If
she
can
get
that
_RARE_
together
,
King
will
feel
good
about
her
chances
against
the
Spain
's
_RARE_
_RARE_
of
Arantxa
Sanchez
Vicario
and
Conchita
Martinez
.

"
To
be
a
great
coach
you
have
to
have
the
right
_RARE_
and
I
got
the
right
_RARE_
,

injury

decided

continue

"
A
win
is
a
win
.

I
'll
take
it
,
"
Edberg
,
who
has
announced
that
this
will
be
his
last
Grand
Slam
event
,
said
of
the
3-6
6-3
6-3
1-0
victory
.

_RARE_
,
_RARE_
two
years
ago
ended
_RARE_
_RARE_
's
Grand
Slam
career
here
when
the
former
champion
had
to
_RARE_
in
the
_RARE_
of
their
first-round
match
.

After
_RARE_
the
_RARE_
come
out
early
in
the
third
set
,
Edberg
was
not
_RARE_
by
_RARE_
's
decision
not
to
go
on
.

"
I
knew
he
had
problems
with
something
,
"
Edberg
said
.
"

I
really
was
n't
_RARE_
.
"

Edberg
had
his
own
problems
early
in
the
match
as
the
_RARE_
_RARE_
to
_RARE_
himself
to
the
_RARE_
conditions
while
_RARE_
was
_RARE_
_RARE_
shots
and
_RARE_
_RARE_
past
him
.

"
I
did
n't
really
feel
good
to
begin
with
,
I
had
problems
finding
the
_RARE_
on
the
ball
,
_RARE_
the
ball
,
"
said
Edberg
,
who
_RARE_
Wimbledon
champion
and
_RARE_
Richard
Krajicek
in
the
first
round
.

"
This
was
one
of
these
matches
where
I
did
n't
play
up
to
my
_RARE_
.

I
had
to
fight
hard
.
"

Edberg
's
_RARE_
paid
off
in
the
second
set
.

Edberg
lost
his
own
serve
twice
,
but
he
rallied
for
three
_RARE_
of
his
own
,
the
last
to
_RARE_
up
the
set
.

"
That
's
where
the
match
_RARE_
of
changed
,
"
said
Edberg
.
"

I
think
once
I
got
that
second
set
,
I
felt
a
lot
better
about
my
game
.
"

Edberg
is
starting
to
feel
pretty
good
about
_RARE_
his
_RARE_
_RARE_
a
lot
longer
.

"
It
does
n't
look
all
that
bad
,
"
Edberg
said
of
his
_RARE_
through
the
draw
starting
next
with
a
match
against
Krajicek
's
Dutch
_RARE_
Paul
_RARE_
.

However
,
the
1991
and
1992
champion
is
not
ready
to
start
making
plans
to
be
in
next
week
's
final
.

"
I
'm
always
being
_RARE_
,
"
said
Edberg
.
"

_RARE_
I
said
many
times
,
I
think
it
's
a
very
little
chance
,
but
nothing
is
impossible
.

If
I
play
great
tennis
,
that
could
take
me
a
long
way
.

"
A
lot
of
things
can
happen
,
like
_RARE_

The

of

to

and
about

most
to

In

Most

who
were
arrested
in
the
May
crackdown
,
including
_RARE_

The
military
government
,
which
in
May
said
it
had
detained
the
politicians
to
prevent
_RARE_
,
said
the
activists
were
charged
with
_RARE_
to
_RARE_
the
peace

_RARE_
of
the
state
.

But
_RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
with
the
_RARE_
,
saying
officials
often
arrested
_RARE_
supporters
in
the
_RARE_
of
the
night
,
then
did
not
give
them
the
opportunity
to
_RARE_
themselves
in

"
When
our

are
tried
,
they
are

before
being

Several
other
leading
members
of
the
_RARE_
have
served
prison

The

party

_RARE_
,
never

"
This
lack
of
rule
of
law
is
an
_RARE_
that
the
authorities
are
not
_RARE_
in
fair
play
,
"
she
said
.
"

They
are
using
a
_RARE_
of
the
law
to
try
and
_RARE_
our
_RARE_
and
to
sentence
our
people
to
long
terms
in
prison
without
_RARE_
trial
.
"

_RARE_
_RARE_
said
once
the
activists
were
sentenced
,
they
suffered
_RARE_
conditions
and
lack
of
rights
in
prison
.

"
_RARE_
all
of
the
prisoners
start
suffering
from
various
health
problems
after
a
couple
of
years
in
jail
,
"
she
said
.
"

Some
of
our
people
have
been
in
prison
for
five

six

_RARE_
_RARE_
like

and

abuse
.

"
If
there
are
any
more
_RARE_
of
death
in
custody
it
will
be
further
_RARE_
that
a
prison
sentence
for
political
prisoners
is
sometimes
almost
the
same
as
a
death
sentence
,
